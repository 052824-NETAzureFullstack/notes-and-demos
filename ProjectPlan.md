# Hobby App
## Build an app to practice the concepts we discuss and work through together.

## Functional Requirements
- Connect to a 3rd party (external) api.
- Build an Angular SPA front end.
- Document user stories (in a README.md) to track the progress you make on the development of your app.


## Phase II
Build your own API using C# and ASP.NET to perform CRUD operations to a database. Use the new API to support your Angular SPA functionality.

## Functional Requirements
- Design and build an ASP.NET API
- Design a SQL Server database to povide data persistance to your API
- Connect your API to the database using Entity Framework Core (EF Core)
- Connect your Angular SPA to the API to provide data objects and functionality to the front end.
