<!-- 
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML structure.
    With the front-end user experience the visual aspect of our pages becomes more and more important because we want our pages
    to look good, be user friendly, and accessible

    Inline
        Uses the style attribute on any relevant element and allows you to style that specific element

    Internal
        Uses the style TAG inside of the head tag

    External

        The paragraph (p) tag is a block element, the span tag is the inline alternative (it only takes up the necessary space)

            What is an Id? An Id is a unique identifier allowing you to locate one specific element in the html page.
            There's nothing stopping you from overloading these names by accident so be careful but this can be used for both
            CSS and JS

            A Class is an identifier allowing you to select MULTIPLE elements (as opposed to one with the Id attribute)
            This can also be used in CSS and JS and is useful if you're attempting to apply styling or logic to multiple blocks of HTML
