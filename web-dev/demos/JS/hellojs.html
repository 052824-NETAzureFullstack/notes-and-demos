    <!-- Recall from yesterday that most webpages are constructed using three different files. The HTML File dictates the structure of the 
    the page itself, the CSS file dictates the styling that the HTML elements have and finally, the JS file dictates the functionality of
    the web page (provide function to buttons, clicking on things, etc). We linked in an external CSS page yesterday in the head of the
    HTML document with the <link> tag. For JS the typical practice is to use a <script> tag at the bottom of the body of the HTML doc -->

        <!-- <script>
            // Everything inside here is pure JS (very similar to how the style tag works from yesterday)
        </script> -->

        <script src="./hellojs.js"></script>
