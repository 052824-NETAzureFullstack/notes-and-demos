        What is an event? 

        An event is basically an interaction with the web page itself. This could be a variety of things
        from clicking, to mousing over, to pressing a key or focusing on one element or another

        Using JS we can listen for any one of these events and do some logic based off that

    <h1>Register a New User: </h1>

    <label for="usernameInput">Username: </label>
    <input id="usernameInput" type="text" placeholder="Username" onmouseover="usernameMouseOver()">

    <label for="passwordInput">Password: </label>
    <input id="passwordInput" type="password" placeholder="Password">

    <button id="createNewUserButton" >Create New User!</button>
