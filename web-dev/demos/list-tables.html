    <!-- Whenever you go an view a recipe online, usually there's a blog or some details first (we'll omit this for simplicity)
    
        but after that, there are a couple different pieces: ingredients list, step-by-step instructions, nutrition info

        ingredient list -> unordered list: This is a list that has no order, it doesn't really matter if you grab salt before pepper as long
        as you have both when it come time to cook

        step-by-step instructions -> ordered list: This is a list with order, you need to follow the previous steps before trying the next or
        you may cook something out of order or not be prepared for the following steps

        nutrution info: this is some sort of table that has info about protetin, fats, sugars, etc and the amounts associated with them
