    This can be multiline or singleline, it doesn't really matter as long as it is contained

    The very first uncommented line in an HTML page should be the doctype declaration which basicall says this is an HTML document

<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- After the doctype declaration we have the root tag for an html page

    HTML (Hypertext markup language) is a tag-based markup language that allows us to define the structure of a web page

    Elements: (Sometimes referred to as tags) pieces of info that determine things about the web page and what gets rendered on the screen
    Attributes: Different ways we can affect those elements (applying styling, hiding, adding a unique identifier, etc)
-->

<html>
    <!-- There are two major pieces inside an html tag
    
        Head: Contains metadata about the webpage (tabname, styling, any links etc)
        Body: Contains the actual info of what's rendered on the page itself
    -->

    <head>
        <!-- The title will be the tab name for the web page -->
        <title>Intro to HTML</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <!-- Everything inside of here actually gets rendered on the page itself! -->
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>

        <!-- The body of the html document can have a variety of different tags
            <h1> - <h6> -> These are used for different headers, getting progressively smaller
            <p> -> This is used for general text (paragraph tag)
            <input> -> Allows you to take in user input
            <button> -> This is used to create a button
            <img> -> used for images
            <ol> <ul> <li> -> These are used for different lists
            <table> for tables
            <div> This creates a division on the page to hold related elements together
            <a> stands for anchor tag (used to link between html pages)
        -->

        <!-- With headers, the bigger the number the smaller the text -->
        <h2>This is an h2 Heading</h2>
        <h5> This is a subheading</h5>

        <p> This is used for general text and various paragraphs.




            As a reminder, HTML doesn't care about whitespace
        </p>

        <div>
            <p>This could be a sample form: </p>
            <input placeholder="Username" type="text">
            <input placeholder="Password" type="password">
            <button>Login!</button>
        </div>

        <!-- Using the a tag brings up a point we should talk about, specifically inline vs block elements in HTML
        
        
            block -> elements that take up the entire width of their container (h#, p)
            inline -> elements that only take up the necessary space (a, span, input)
        -->
    </body>
